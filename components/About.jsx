      <p className="p-4">
        Amidst the constantly changing genres, Kri Samadhi has exhibited a
        continuing passion for the depth and sound that evolved from Goa Trance
        in the early days of the scene. While playing and composing driving
        tracks that always demonstrate skilled musicianship, Kri rouses
        listeners into fluid, euphoric motion and paints the party a vibrant
        psychedelic shade.
      </p>
      <p className="p-4">
        DJing since 1992, playing and producing Psychedelic Goa Trance since
        1996, Kri demonstrates immense dedication to the art by his ceaseless
        attention to every detail of the experience. Be it playing, composing,
        mastering, or promoting, there is no area in which Kri falters, making
        sure to work respectfully alongside other gifted artists devoted to the
        scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kri has earned the respect of promoters and members of the psytrance
        family around the world, and his professional approach to event
        production has elevated the TOUCH Samadhi annual fall gathering to one
        of the premier trance festivals on the East coast of the United States,
        blending a rich variety of live and electronic musical performance,
        sublime psychedelic visual art, and a message of universal peace, which
        together catapult attendees into intergalactic spiritual bliss.
      </p>
      <p className="p-4">
        As a performer, Kri weaves a musical spell that indulges listeners into
        easily merging with and being uplifted by his music. The sound he
        creates through his live act is being heralded around the planet and is
        breathing simmering new life into the Trance world as if the music is
        propelled by a dragon high on Kundalini yoga. Kriâ€™s superb intuition for
        playing to the human element produces a dance floor experience of
        complete immersion, of carnal union with the velvety flow of the beat,
        the body, the bass, the boom. Kri brings us music that forces us to
        remember why we are alive and to give thanks for every nuance of that
        sacred gift.
